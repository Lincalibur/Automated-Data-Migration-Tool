# Automated Data Migration Tool (ADMT)

The Automated Data Migration Tool (ADMT) is designed to simplify and automate the process of migrating data from various sources to different databases, with support for multiple file formats and cloud platforms. The tool includes a user-friendly interface for configuring migration settings, mapping data fields, scheduling migrations, and monitoring progress.

## Features

- **Support for Various Data Sources**: Integrates with multiple databases, file formats, and cloud platforms.
- **ETL Automation**: Automates Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) processes to streamline data migration.
- **Mapping Tool**: Allows users to map data fields between source and destination systems easily.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging to facilitate troubleshooting.
- **User Interface**: A dashboard for configuring migrations, mapping fields, scheduling tasks, and monitoring progress.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle migrations of varying sizes and complexities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [List other dependencies, e.g., database drivers, cloud SDKs]

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lincalibur/Automated-Data-Migration-Tool.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Automated-Data-Migration-Tool
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

- Configure your data sources and settings in the `config/config.yaml` file. Provide necessary details such as database connection strings, file paths, and cloud credentials.

### Running the Tool

- Run the main script to start the tool:

    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

### Usage

1. **Configure Data Sources**: Set up your source and destination data connections in the configuration file.
2. **Map Data Fields**: Use the mapping tool to align source and destination data fields.
3. **Schedule Migrations**: Define migration schedules to automate the process.
